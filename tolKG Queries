**Knowledge Graph Queries for tolKG**  

This document provides **SPARQL queries** that can be executed on **tolKG** to explore **tolerogenic dendritic cell (tolDC) therapies, biomarkers, drug interactions, and research trends**.  

---

1. Identify Key Cell markers in tolDC Therapies **
Purpose: Retrieve the most frequently mentioned cytokines in tolDC-related studies.

***sparql

SELECT ?cellmarker (COUNT(?mention) AS ?frequency)
WHERE {
  ?study :mentions ?cellmarker
  ?cytokine rdf:type :cellmarker
}
GROUP BY ?cellmarker
ORDER BY DESC(?frequency)
LIMIT 10
---

2. Explore Drug-Pathway Interactions **
Purpose: Find drugs associated with immune pathways relevant to tolDC research.

***sparql

SELECT ?drug ?pathway
WHERE {
  ?drug rdf:type :Drug .
  ?drug :targets ?protein .
  ?protein :involvedIn ?pathway .
}
LIMIT 20
---
3. Detect Biomarkers for tolDC Therapy **
Purpose: Identify genes frequently associated with successful tolDC-based immunotherapies.

***sparql

SELECT ?gene (COUNT(?association) AS ?frequency)
WHERE {
  ?gene rdf:type :Gene .
  ?gene :associatedWith ?therapy .
  ?therapy rdf:type :tolDCTherapy .
}
GROUP BY ?gene
ORDER BY DESC(?frequency)
LIMIT 15
---
4. Predict Possible Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) in tolDC Treatments **
Purpose: Identify drugs that share common protein targets, indicating potential interactions.

sparql

SELECT ?drug1 ?drug2 ?commonTarget
WHERE {
  ?drug1 :targets ?commonTarget .
  ?drug2 :targets ?commonTarget .
  FILTER(?drug1 != ?drug2)
}
LIMIT 25
---
6. Disease Associations in tolDC-Based Treatments **
Purpose: Identify diseases most commonly linked to tolDC therapy.

*** sparql

SELECT ?disease (COUNT(?study) AS ?count)
WHERE {
  ?study :investigates ?disease .
  ?study :usesTherapy ?therapy .
  ?therapy rdf:type :tolDCTherapy .
}
GROUP BY ?disease
ORDER BY DESC(?count)
LIMIT 10
